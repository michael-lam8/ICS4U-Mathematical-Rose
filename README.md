This derivative of Dan Shiffman's Mathematical Rose Patterns Coding Challenge features object-oriented code, and several design changes. This includes the addition of a slider to change the stroke weight, as well as a change in stroke colour.

With the addition of object-oriented code, it is possible to change the colour of each rose instance. Note that this code represents a basic overview of object-oriented programming, as the current code leaves the coordinates in the same location on the canvas, and manually creates sliders outside of the Rose object. The code can be expanded on in the future to create multiple instances of the roses with different locations and their own sliders.
